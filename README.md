## RimWorld – Vaccines Mod

A mod made by me :) Created purely with XML and Aseprite 1.2.9x.

### Mod Function

A simple mod that adds craftable vaccines to prevent most common illnesses.  
Meant to be a better and more expensive alternative to Penoxycyline.

You can check the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/Hashimini/Vaccines_Mod/blob/main/Wiki.md) for detailed information.

### Basic Walkthrough

**1st**  
- Buy the Techprint from an Empire trade caravan.

**2nd**  
- Research the specific vaccine you want or need.

**3rd**  
- Gather the materials: 1x Hemogen Pack and 2x Neutroamine.

**4th**  
- Use a colonist with at least 14 Medicine skill at a Drug Lab workbench to craft the vaccine.

**5th**  
- Select the colonist and right-click the vaccine to use it.  
  *The immunity effect lasts for 5 in-game years.*

## Installation

- Download the mod from the Releases section, preferably the latest version.  
- Extract the download file with [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=9) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
- Place the extracted folder in your game’s Mods directory.
